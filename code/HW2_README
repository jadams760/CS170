Debug flags used:
  - '2': Required output given in the project specification.

  - 's': Errors encountered during syscall execution

Files modified/added:
  - addrspace.cc/.h: Modified binary loader to write to translated memory
  - exception.cc: Check incoming system calls, call relevant handler code, then
    increment program counter. Handles multiprogramming calls.
  - memmanage.cc/.h: Memory manager. Tracks free and allocated pages
  - psblock.cc/.h: The process control block, which stores the PID, parentPID,
    thread, and opened files for a process
  - psmanage.cc/.h: Process manager. Tracks allocated PIDs and deals with
    joining on processes.
